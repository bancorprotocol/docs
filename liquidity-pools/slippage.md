# Slippage

Slippage in a Bancor liquidity pool is a direct function of the size of the pool and the size of the trade. The greater the size of the pool, the lesser the slippage. The greater the size of the trade, the greater the slippage.

A key powerful feature of Bancor liquidity pools is that a trader doesn't need to find a counterparty. But because the network's continuous liquidity model requires that a pool holds a set value of each of its underlying assets, as the trade of asset ABC in exchange for asset XYZ grows larger, the remaining pool balance post-trade of asset ABC will grow and the balance of XYZ will diminish. 

After the trade is completed, the holdings of each asset in the pool are still equivalent in value according to Bancor's bonding curve formula \(as they always are\). But the trader must compensate the pool for the distortion in the value relation between the two holdings, i.e., slippage.
