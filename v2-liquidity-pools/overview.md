description: Understanding the basics of liquidity pools & Bancor v2.1
---

# Overview

Liquidity pools are smart contracts that hold one or more token reserves. Designed to serve as an automated market maker (AMM) for traders, Bancor liquidity pools offer a contrast to more conventional order-book exchanges in their simplicity and transparency.&#x20;

As of the v2.1 update (October 2020), Bancor introduced new features that address key challenges facing liquidity providers (LPs) to AMMs. Mainly, v2.1 addresses:

* `Involuntary Token Exposure`: that most AMMs require LPs to contribute liquidity to both assets in a pool, though they might only hold one token

Bancor v2.1 offers:

* `Single-sided exposure`: LPs provide liquidity in a single token and maintain 100% exposure to the token
