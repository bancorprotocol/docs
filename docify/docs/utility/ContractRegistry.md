Contract Registry

The contract registry keeps contract addresses by name.

The owner can update contract addresses so that a contract name always points to the latest version

of the given contract.

Other contracts can query the registry to get updated addresses instead of depending on specific

addresses.

Note that contract names are limited to 32 bytes UTF8 encoded ASCII strings to optimize gas costs
