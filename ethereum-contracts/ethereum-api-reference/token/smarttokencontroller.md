The smart token controller is an upgradable part of the smart token that allows

more functionality as well as fixes for bugs/exploits.

Once it accepts ownership of the token, it becomes the token's sole controller

that can execute any of its functions.

To upgrade the controller, ownership must be transferred to a new controller, along with

any relevant data.

The smart token must be set on construction and cannot be changed afterwards.

Wrappers are provided (as opposed to a single 'execute' function) for each of the token's functions, for easier access.

Note that the controller can transfer token ownership to a new controller that

doesn't allow executing any function on the token, for a trustless solution.

Doing that will also remove the owner's ability to upgrade the controller.

# Function `constructor(contract ISmartToken _token)` {#SmartTokenController-constructor-contract-ISmartToken-}

initializes a new SmartTokenController instance

## Parameters:

- `_token`:      smart token governed by the controller

# Function `transferTokenOwnership(address _newOwner)` {#SmartTokenController-transferTokenOwnership-address-}

allows transferring the token ownership

the new owner needs to accept the transfer

can only be called by the contract owner

## Parameters:

- `_newOwner`:    new token owner

# Function `acceptTokenOwnership()` {#SmartTokenController-acceptTokenOwnership--}

used by a new owner to accept a token ownership transfer

can only be called by the contract owner

# Function `withdrawFromToken(contract IERC20Token _token, address _to, uint256 _amount)` {#SmartTokenController-withdrawFromToken-contract-IERC20Token-address-uint256-}

withdraws tokens held by the controller and sends them to an account

can only be called by the owner

## Parameters:

- `_token`:   ERC20 token contract address

- `_to`:      account to receive the new amount

- `_amount`:  amount to withdraw

# Function `claimTokens(address _from, uint256 _amount)` {#SmartTokenController-claimTokens-address-uint256-}

allows the associated BancorX contract to claim tokens from any address (so that users

dont have to first give allowance when calling BancorX)

## Parameters:

- `_from`:      address to claim the tokens from

- `_amount`:    the amount of tokens to claim

# Function `setBancorX(address _bancorX)` {#SmartTokenController-setBancorX-address-}

allows the owner to set the associated BancorX contract

## Parameters:

- `_bancorX`:    BancorX contract
