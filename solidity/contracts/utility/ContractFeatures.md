Contract Features

Generic contract that allows every contract on the blockchain to define which features it supports.

Other contracts can query this contract to find out whether a given contract on the

blockchain supports a certain feature.

Each contract type can define its own list of feature flags.

Features can be only enabled/disabled by the contract they are defined for.

Features should be defined by each contract type as bit flags, e.g. -

uint256 public constant FEATURE1 = 1 << 0;

uint256 public constant FEATURE2 = 1 << 1;

uint256 public constant FEATURE3 = 1 << 2;

# Function `constructor()` {#ContractFeatures-constructor--}

initializes a new ContractFeatures instance

# Function `isSupported(address _contract, uint256 _features) â†’ bool` {#ContractFeatures-isSupported-address-uint256-}

returns true if a given contract supports the given feature(s), false if not

## Parameters:

- `_contract`:    contract address to check support for

- `_features`:    feature(s) to check for

## Return Values:

- true if the contract supports the feature(s), false if not

# Function `enableFeatures(uint256 _features, bool _enable)` {#ContractFeatures-enableFeatures-uint256-bool-}

allows a contract to enable/disable certain feature(s)

## Parameters:

- `_features`:    feature(s) to enable/disable

- `_enable`:      true to enable the feature(s), false to disabled them

# Event `FeaturesAddition(address _address, uint256 _features)` {#ContractFeatures-FeaturesAddition-address-uint256-}

triggered when a contract notifies of features it supports

## Parameters:

- `_address`:     contract address

- `_features`:    features supported

# Event `FeaturesRemoval(address _address, uint256 _features)` {#ContractFeatures-FeaturesRemoval-address-uint256-}

triggered when a contract notifies of features it no longer supports

## Parameters:

- `_address`:     contract address

- `_features`:    features no longer supported
