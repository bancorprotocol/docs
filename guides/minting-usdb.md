# Minting USDB

USDB, a stable token backed by BNT, can be used to create stable liquidity pools on [Bancor CoTrader](https://bancor.cotrader.com/).

**Stable:Stable** pools \(e.g., **DAI:USDB** or **USDT:USDB**\) eliminate price movements in the pool’s assets, eliminating impermanent loss and maximizing the profitability of conversion fees.

### Step \#1: Unlock BNT

* Navigate to the [USDB page on Peg Network](https://usdb.peg.network/)
* On the `Quick Actions` tab in the `Deposit` section, click **Unlock BNT**
* Confirm this transaction

### Step \#2: Mint USDB

* On the `Quick Actions` tab in the `Borrow` section, you'll see the balance you have available to mint. This will be 50% of the value of the BNT you’ve deposited
* Input the amount you'd like to borrow in USDB and click **Borrow**
* Confirm this transaction
