# Trading on Bancor

Trading is the core value proposition to users of Bancor Network. The easiest way to trade is to use the [Bancor Dapp](https://www.bancor.network/). This is the recommended entry point to trading on Bancor for new users.

Bancor is also integrated with several decentralized exchange aggregators like [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/#/), [X Nation](http://xnation.io/), [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/#/) and [DEX.AG](http://dex.ag/). When you use these platforms, your trades may be routed through Bancor. 

Other ways to trade via Bancor include the Bancor Widget, which can be embedded by third parties on their sites, and via smart contract interface, where a third party developer has integrated Bancor into their smart contract.

## Trading via Etherscan

If you want to trade directly on the `BancorNetwork` contract, Etherscan's web UI makes it quite easy. Additionally, this guide will be helpful for developers looking to [interface with Bancor contracts](https://docs.bancor.network/guides/interfacing-with-bancor-contracts) via their own smart contract.
