# Accepting Ownership of Liquidity Pools

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that only the address that has been transferred ownership will be able to accept.
{% endhint %}

From time to time, you may need to upgrade your **Converter** contract. In order to upgrade, you'll need to transfer ownership from the wallet that previously deployed the token contract. Once ownership has been transferred, the target address will have to accept it. 

* Navigate to the contract on Etherscan
* Execute the `acceptOwnership` function
